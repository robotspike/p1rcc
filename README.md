Analysis of papillary renal-cell carcinoma type 1 (p1RCC) genetic markers and beyond.

In conjunction with:

The goals are to understand/model p1RCC and then research into existing/novel interventions and therapeutics. An exploration of the data will be made using tools available to attempt to create a twining rivers and/or circuit breaker model. If the relevant genes are identified with some confidence, research into interventions and therapeutics will begin using drug design and deepchem.
